Source compound molecules were prepared in the following ways:

autogrow4/source_compounds/naphthalene_smiles.smi:
    -This list was taken from AutoGrow 3.1.3's naphthalene source molecules.
    These ligands were converted to SMILES from PDB usings openbabel

autogrow4/source_compounds/PARPi.smi:
    -This is a list of 11 PARPi from FDA.org.

autogrow4/source_compounds/PARPI_BRICS_frags.smi
    - This contains the 11 PARPi from source_compounds/PARPi.smi as well as fragments from each of those PARPi.
    - The 83 fragments were generated using rdkit's BRIC decomposition function
    - A minimum size for fragments was 3 non-hydrogen atoms

ZINC molecules:
    The following four ligand libraries are based on the predefined in-stock fragments library from ZINC15 on 10/21/19

    This starting list was ligands from 1.0>=logp>3.5 and MW<=250da. This consisted of 80 tranches and 682,820 starting ligands

    This list was filtered to ensure every ligand in the ligand has atleast one moiety that would react in the All_Rxn reaction list.

    We then seperated these by MW ranges and capped the size to 5,000 randomized ligands:
        1) MW >=100da           :  autogrow4/source_compounds/Fragment_MW_up_to_100.smi
        2) 100da > MW >=150da   :  autogrow4/source_compounds/Fragment_MW_100_to_150.smi
        3) 150da > MW >=200da   :  autogrow4/source_compounds/Fragment_MW_150_to_200.smi
        4) 200da > MW >=250da   :  autogrow4/source_compounds/Fragment_MW_200_to_250.smi
